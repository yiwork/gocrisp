SONG – Captain.
Capt.	I am the Captain of the Pinafore;
All.	And a right good captain, too!
Capt.		You’re very, very good,
		And be it understood,
	I command a right good crew.
All.		We’re very, very good,
		And be it understood,
	He commands a right good crew.
Capt.	Though related to a peer,
	I can hand, reef, and steer,
		And ship a selvagee;
	I am never known to quail
	At the fury of a gale,
		And I’m never, never sick at sea!
All.			What, never?
Capt.				No, never!
All.			What, never?
Capt.				Hardly ever!
All.	He’s hardly ever sick at sea!
	Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
	For the hardy Captain of the Pinafore!
Capt.	I do my best to satisfy you all –
All.	And with you we’re quite content.
Capt.		You’re exceedingly polite,
		And I think it only right
	To return the compliment.
All.		We’re exceedingly polite,
		And he thinks it’s only right
	To return the compliment.
Capt.		Bad language or abuse,
		I never, never use,
	Whatever the emergency;
		Though “Bother it” I may
		Occasionally say,
	I never use a big, big D –
All.			What, never?
Capt.				No, never!
All.			What, never?
Capt.				Well, hardly ever!
All.	Hardly ever swears a big, big D –
	Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
	For the well-bred Captain of the Pinafore!
